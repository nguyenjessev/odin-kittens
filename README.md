# Odin Kittens
A practice project demonstrating creating an API.

# Task
Create a site that allows for the creation, editing, and deletion of kitten resources. Also allow API requests to be made to get JSON objects containing a list of kittens, or a particular kitten.

# What I used
Rails and the respond_to function.

# What I learned
How to allow controller actions respond to external API requests and to return results in different formats (JSON, in this case)
